# List - Random Picker

A Flutter project created for studying purposes and at the same time to help me picking random people to talk during my teams daily standup meetings.

## Behavior

 1. **Clear List**: Delete all the list items
 2. **Add**: Add what is in the "new item" edit
 3. **Check** (right bottom action button) - Randomly pick someone in the list
	 - **Keep**: Allow the item to be picked again
	 - **Mark as picked**: Prevent the item to be picked again
 4. **Clock Return**: Restore all the items to a "not picked" state
